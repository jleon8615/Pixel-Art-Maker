# Pixel-Art-Maker
This project was my final project from Udacity Intro to Programming ND.
The purpose of this project was to build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.
Clone  or download the code,  then drag the index file into your browser to interact with my pixel art design
